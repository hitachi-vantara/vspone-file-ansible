To build these modules into an installable Ansible Collection, which can then be distributed, requires an install of Ansible 2.9 or newer.

In the root of the set of files run:

ansible-galaxy collection build

Which will generate hitachi-hnas-1.x.x.tar.gz file in the root.  To force an overwrite of a previous build, run:

ansible-galaxy collection build --force

To install the new Ansible Collection, run:

ansible-galaxy collection install hitachi-hnas-1.x.x.tar.gz

This should overwrite the previous install, provided that the namespace and filenames do not change.
